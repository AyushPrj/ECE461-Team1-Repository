## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies 
To install dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:
```
bash 
go mod download 
```

### Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

Replace <your-github-token> with your GitHub token, <log-level> with the desired log level (e.g. debug, info, warning, error, etc.), and <path-to-log-file> with the path to the log file.
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token>
LOG_LEVEL=<log-level>
LOG_FILE=<path-to-log-file>
```

Once you have installed the dependencies and set up the environment variables, you can start using the CLI.
